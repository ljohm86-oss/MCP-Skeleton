- included full and incremental compression flows, dry-run replay previews, policy-aware replay gates, merge-aware replay checks, and scale benchmark tooling
- promoted incremental `context apply-check` into the public surface, including top-level incremental metadata, summary fields, and dedicated smoke coverage
- enabled incremental `context patch-apply`, including incremental replay manifest updates and standalone smoke coverage
- enriched incremental patch dry-run reports with scope, per-lane counts, and first-path summary fields
- added a formal full-vs-incremental benchmark report for the standalone `MCP-Skeleton` repository
